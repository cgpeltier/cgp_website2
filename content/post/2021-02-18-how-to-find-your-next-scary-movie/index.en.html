<p>Since college, my friends and I have had scary movie nights where we watch a different horror movie. I tend to like supernatural horror movies, zombie movies, and anything that is surreal/dream-like, like Twin Peaks. I’m not as in to slashers, true crime, anything <em>Saw</em>-like, or body horror movies. However, just going through the top horror movies on Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB doesn’t always align with our group’s tastes.</p>
<p>So this project is intended to analyze horror movies in more detail, using their keyword descriptors and other metadata to create better recommendations.</p>
<p>To start out, I scraped IMDB for all horror movies with at least 25,000 ratings (which is about 700 of them). I then analyze the resulting metadata, and finally I created a Shiny app, which is <a href="https://chad-peltier.shinyapps.io/horror_movies/">available here</a>.</p>
<p>The app allows you to see movies filtered using a subset of IMDB keywords, rated by their IMDB score and the year they were released, as well as a separate tab showing movie recommendations based on cosine similarity networks (top 10 most similar movies).</p>

<h1>Scrape IMDB</h1>
<p>First is scraping IMDB. The first thing we’ll do is pull links to each movie’s IMDB page. This is pretty straightforward – writing a function to pull links, which can then be looped across the URLs using <code>purrr::map_dfr</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## make function
get_imdb_id &lt;- function(page){
  
    read_html(paste0(&quot;https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&amp;num_votes=25000,&amp;genres=horror&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;start=&quot;, page, &quot;&amp;ref_=adv_nxt&quot;)) %&gt;%
    html_nodes(&quot;a&quot;) %&gt;%
    html_attr(&quot;href&quot;) %&gt;%
    tibble(links = .) %&gt;%
    filter(str_detect(links, &quot;title/tt&quot;)) %&gt;%
    mutate(links = str_extract(links, &quot;tt\\d+&quot;)) %&gt;%
    distinct() 
}


## scrape all pages 
pages &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 700, by = 50)

horror_ids &lt;- map_dfr(pages, get_imdb_id) </code></pre>
<p>The next step is to pull all relevant info from the movie’s page. There’s a lot of content on these pages, so a big custom function will be needed to pull each node (which I gathered using Selector Gadget). Using <code>furrr</code> to parallelize this process was key :)</p>
<p>Obviously the IMDB dataset is a foundational one for NLP benchmarks and research. But that one is old, and I wanted to include more recent movies. There are also several R packages that use the OMDB API, but that API is limited to 1000 calls per day (and I wasn’t sure if it supported the keywords and all of the other data available by scraping the website).</p>

<p>The final step in cleaning the base data is to create dummy variable columns for all of the secondary genres (i.e. a horror-comedy or horror-action movie).</p>

<div id="cosine-similarity" class="section level1">
<h1>Cosine similarity</h1>
<p>David Robinson’s excellent <code>widyr</code> package makes document similarity through cosine similarity (or in this case, movie keyword similarity) easy. First, I unnested the tokens from the keywords column, then add tf-idf scores. Then I just needed to use the <code>widyr::pairwise similarity</code> function to calculate movie similarity based on those keywords.</p>
<p>The keywords themselves are all over the place. Some are generic, some are related to the director or the actors, some have plot points or film techniques… it’s really a mixed bag. Nevertheless, I think the results are pretty good.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## create unnested token df 
horror_words &lt;- horror3 %&gt;%
    select(id, keywords) %&gt;%
    unnest_tokens(word, keywords, token = &quot;regex&quot;, pattern = &quot; \\| &quot;) %&gt;%
    filter(word != &quot;reference&quot;) %&gt;%
    count(id, word, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%
    bind_tf_idf(word, id, n) %&gt;%
    arrange(desc(tf_idf))

## create similarity df
horror_sim &lt;- horror_words %&gt;%
    pairwise_similarity(id, word, tf_idf, upper = FALSE, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%
    left_join(horror3 %&gt;% 
                  select(id, title1 = title, imdb_rating1 = imdb_rating, keywords1 = keywords), 
              by = c(&quot;item1&quot; = &quot;id&quot;)) %&gt;%
    left_join(horror3 %&gt;% 
                  select(id, title2 = title, imdb_rating2 = imdb_rating),
              by = c(&quot;item2&quot; = &quot;id&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>For example, the movie combinations that have the highest overall similarity are either remakes, sequels, or other-language versions of the same movie:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>horror_sim %&gt;%
    head() %&gt;%
    select(title1, title2, similarity)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3

<p>Next, I made a function to show the top 10 most similar movies to your search, with the fill color based on their IMDB ratings.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## function to visualize most similar movies
make_similar_chart &lt;- function(movie) {

    top_n(n = 10, wt = similarity) %&gt;%

<p>Eraserhead, one of my favorite scary movies, has some great recommendations. I haven’t seen The Taking of Deborah Logan, so that’s a good recommendation (even if its IMDB rating is on the lower side). But I really liked Suspiria, and Deep Red has been on my list for a while (since I watched the original Suspiria!). I also <em>loved</em> Annihilation (the shots of the fingerprints moving around, or the girl transforming into the tree were haunting!).</p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/op-ed-text-analysis/">David’s article on who wrote the “Anonymous” letter in the <em>New York Times</em></a>, I also made a function to show the keywords that influenced the similarity scores for a movie’s top matches. The code below is largely taken from David:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Words contributing to similarity scores
word_similarities &lt;- function(movie) {
  tf_idf &lt;- horror_words %&gt;%
      left_join(horror3 %&gt;% select(id, title)) %&gt;%
      group_by(title) %&gt;%
      mutate(normalized = tf_idf / sqrt(sum(tf_idf ^ 2))) %&gt;%
      ungroup()
  
  word_combinations &lt;- tf_idf %&gt;%
      filter(title == movie) %&gt;%
      select(-title) %&gt;%
      inner_join(tf_idf, by = &quot;word&quot;, suffix = c(&quot;_movie&quot;, &quot;_similar&quot;)) %&gt;%
      filter(title != movie) %&gt;%
      mutate(contribution = normalized_movie * normalized_similar) %&gt;%
      arrange(desc(contribution)) %&gt;%
      select(title, word, tf_idf_movie, tf_idf_similar, contribution)

      filter(title %in% head(horror_sim %&gt;% filter(title1 == movie) %&gt;% pull(title2))) %&gt;%
      mutate(title = reorder(title, -contribution, sum),

}

<p><img src="eraserhead_words.png" /></p>
<p>Next, we can also do some unsupervized learning using LDA to see if there are any horror subgenres that emerge from their keywords:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## LDA
library(topicmodels)

h_dtm &lt;- horror3 %&gt;%
    rename(text = keywords) %&gt;%

<p>Pretty interesting! Topic 1 seems to be about ghostly children (like <em>The Omen</em>, I’m guessing!). Topic 2 might be zombie-related, 4 looks like true-crime/serial killer kind of stuff, as does 7 (which brings in detectives to the mix). 8 is space-related horror (<em>Alien</em>!), and 10 is vampires!</p>
<p>Next, I made similarity networks based on the top 10 most-similar movies to each movie. This allows us to see which movies are most similar to other horror movies, and which are more out-there, with fewer descriptors in common with other movies.</p>

<p>Looking at this chart of the top ten highest-rated horror movies, there are some interesting suggestions and relationships here. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Thing</em> and <em>Alien</em> are densely connected. Not only are they in each others’ top tens, they also share four movies in their top tens, like <em>Dreamcatcher</em> and <em>Alien: Covenant</em> that are also about aliens. Both are claustrophobic movies about aliens.</li>
<li>A top-10 movie I’d never heard of before, <em>Tumbbad</em>, is less connected than most of the other top-10. In fact, only <em>Poltergeist</em>, which it shares with <em>The Shining</em>, connects it with the rest of the network.</li>
<li>Psycho is the most densely connected, with only three movies that aren’t connected with other movies in the network.</li>
<li>I really liked both <em>The Shining</em> and <em>1408</em>, so it would be worth exploring what else is in that network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we can do some additional exploratory data analysis, starting with correlations between secondary genres:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(corrr)

    mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %&gt;%

    scale_fill_distiller(palette = &quot;RdBu&quot;, direction = 1) + 
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
    labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-02-18-how-to-find-your-next-scary-movie/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Unsurprising that horror-action-adventure movies are common, as are horror-family-animation movies. Horror-thriller-comedies are very uncommon.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## imdb vs. metacritic scores
horror3 %&gt;%
    drop_na(metacritic_score) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(imdb_rating, metacritic_score)) +
    geom_point() +

<p>There’s a very strong relatonship between IMDB ratings and metacritic scores, although it’s clearly not a 1-1 relationship.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## ratings over time 
horror3 %&gt;%
    filter(year &gt; 1920) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(year, imdb_rating, alpha = 0.4, size = 2)) +

<p>There have been <em>a lot</em> of horror movies released over the last 20 years! This doesn’t show much of a trend in ratings over time. We’ll need to take a look at this another way.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## boxplots of decades 
horror3 %&gt;%
    filter(year &gt; 1920) %&gt;%
    mutate(decade = (year %/% 10) * 10,
           decade = factor(decade)) %&gt;% 
    select(title, imdb_rating, decade, gross_world) %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(imdb_rating, fct_rev(decade), color = decade)) +
    # geom_point() + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x = &quot;IMDB Rating&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) +
    guides(color = FALSE)</code></pre>

<p>Grouping movies by decade shows a more clear trend. Overall the median horror movie has gotten worse by the decade, and the interquartile range has increased significantly since the 1970s. I think a lot of this has to do with the explosion in movies released, not necessarily that older movies are just better.</p>
<p>Finally, we can take a look at the relationship between similarity and rating. For example, are movies that are more unique – as measured by either a lower average similarity rating for their top ten similar movies, or in the number of other movies in which the movie is in their top ten – rated higher?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## movies with low cosine similarity scores
sim_count &lt;- horror_sim %&gt;%
    group_by(item1, title1) %&gt;%

<p>I pulled out a sample of interesting movies for this chart so it’s not too crowded. It shows that there is definitely a cluster of highly-rated and more unique movies, like <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, <em>Get Out</em>, <em>The Lighthouse</em>, and <em>Eraserhead</em>. It’s also interesting to see movies that have a low average similarity with their top ten, but are still in a lot of other movies’ top tens, like <em>Suspiria</em> and <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> (the original). These have really defining features, like <em>Suspiria’s</em> giallo aspects, that distinguish them from other zombie and witch movies.</p>
