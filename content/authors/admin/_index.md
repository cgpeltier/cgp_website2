I am currently a data analyst at Janes. This site contains my data science portfolio and blog. 

I love working on data science projects that involve data wrangling of unstructured data from multiple sources, machine learning and NLP. At Janes I help create new data products, integrate Janes data with our clients’ systems, as well as provide custom data projects. I have written several packages in R, including the [janesR package](https://github.com/cgpeltier/janesR) to help Janes users access the Janes API, and [ggtimeline](https://github.com/cgpeltier/ggtimeline) for creating timeline charts. I also work as a contract data scientist, including with the Library of Congress’s Federal Research Division.

Within defense, I specialize in the analysis of emerging defense technologies, R&D strategy, U.S.-China policy, and the use of data science for open source intelligence (OSINT). You can find some of my work at places like [War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/put-your-money-where-your-strategy-is-using-machine-learning-to-analyze-the-pentagon-budget/), the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission](https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-logistics-capabilities-expeditionary-operations), and [Janes](https://customer.janes.com/Janes/Display/FG_2109926-JIBR).
